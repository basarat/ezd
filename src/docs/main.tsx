  Because its code. 

  Reuse code variables + do fancy **code** stuff like a üëî . 

  e.g. the color of this text is ${colors.text} üåπ

  Docs in JS/TS have so many of the same advantages as [TypeStyle / CSS in JS](http://typestyle.io/#/why).

  /** Show stories */
  eze.md(`
  # Stories
  Stories are lightweight applications designed to showcase simple components.
  
  You write them using \`import {story} from 'eze/lib/client';\`

  As an example the following code:
  `);
  eze.code({
    mode: 'ts',
    code: require('fs').readFileSync(__dirname + '/story-1.tsx').toString()
  });
  eze.md(`
  Produces the following story:
  `);
  eze.story({
    entryPointPath: __dirname + '/story-1.tsx',
  });

  /** Show some complete application demos */
  eze.md(`
  # Embed applications
  You can easily show complete applications. This allows you to showcase application level layouts.
  `);
  eze.app({
    entryPointPath: __dirname + '/app-1.tsx',
    sourceUrl: 'https://github.com/basarat/eze/blob/master/src/docs/app-1.tsx',
    height: '100px',
  });
  eze.md(`
  Embedded applications can use \`import {resize} from 'eze/lib/client';\` to 
  request the containing iframe to be automatically resized.
  `);
  eze.app({
    entryPointPath: __dirname + '/app-2.tsx',
    sourceUrl: 'https://github.com/basarat/eze/blob/master/src/docs/app-2.tsx',
  });
  eze.md(`
  All applications can target the \`root\` element. The following is the HTML that is used:
  `);
  eze.code({
    mode: 'html',
    code: appIndexTemplate({ index: 0, jsFileName: 'app-0.js' }),
  })

  /** Table of contents */
  eze.md(`
  # Table of contents generation
  Generated automatically based on the headings parsed from markdown.
  ## Sample subheading
  Yup. You guessed it. ^ It should be visible in the TOC.
  `);

  /** Development time */
  eze.md(`
  # Devtime
  When working on a styleguide you normally only work on one \`story\` or \`app\` at the time. So both of these take an optional \`only\` argument. E.g.
  `);
  eze.code({
    mode: 'js',
    code: `
eze.story({
  entryPointPath: __dirname + '/story-1.tsx',
  only: true
});      
    `
  });
  eze.md(`
  * Ofcourse you shouldn't commit with 'only' set to true. Use it only locally to speed up demo/story development.
  * You can even open the app / story in a new window using the "open in a new window" link so you can work on it without distraction.
